WP BOOTSTRAP
===================

Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com) in WordPress theme form.

GETTING STARTED
_______________

To get started, open Terminal or a command prompt and run:

	cd path/to/wp-content/themes
	git clone https://github.com/320press/wordpress-bootstrap.git
	npm install
	grunt dev

FEATURES
________

We’ve built the WP Bootstrap theme so that it could be used as-is as a very basic theme or as a starting point for theme developers. It uses v3.3.1 of Bootstrap.

WP-Bootstrap uses grunt as a task manager to help aid development. Check out the gruntfile.js file for more detail on the default tasks. WP-Bootstrap comes with the livereload, less, grunticon and more tasks out of the box. 

Watch or star this project to keep up with its progress.

Multi-Lingual
_____________

WP-Bootstrap is translated in 7 languages - Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Swedish and German. 

Page Templates
______________

We’ve packaged four different page templates into this theme.

    - Homepage template (seen on the homepage of this site - http://www.320press.com/wp-bootstrap)
    - Standard page with right sidebar (this page)
    - Page with left sidebar
    - Full width page

Theme Options Panel
___________________

We've removed the custom theme options panel in version 3.0. Currently working on moving all of the options that used to appear there over to the theme customizer. 

Shortcodes
__________

We’ve built in some shortcodes so you can easily add UI elements found in Bootstrap.

Sidebars
________

There are two different sidebars. One for the homepage and one for the other pages. Add widgets to them.

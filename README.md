#WORDPRESS BOOTSTRAP
===================

Bootstrap (https://github.com/arnabwahid/wordpress-bootstrap/) in WordPress theme form.

# GETTING STARTED

To get started, open Terminal or a command prompt and run:

	cd path/to/wp-content/themes
	git clone https://github.com/arnabwahid/wordpress-bootstrap.git
	npm install
	grunt dev

# FEATURES

Weâ€™ve built the WP Bootstrap theme so that it could be used as-is as a very basic theme or as a starting point for theme developers. It uses v3.3.1 of Bootstrap.

WP-Bootstrap uses grunt as a task manager to help aid development. Check out the gruntfile.js file for more detail on the default tasks. WP-Bootstrap comes with the livereload, less, grunticon and more tasks out of the box.

# Multi-Lingual

WP-Bootstrap is translated in 7 languages - Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Swedish and German. 

# Page Templates
______________

Weâ€™ve packaged four different page templates into this theme.

    - Homepage template (seen on the homepage of this site - http://www.320press.com/wp-bootstrap)
    - Standard page with right sidebar (this page)
    - Page with left sidebar
    - Full width page

# Theme Options Panel

We've removed the custom theme options panel in version 3.0. Currently working on moving all of the options that used to appear there over to the theme customizer. 

# Shortcodes

Weâ€™ve built in some shortcodes so you can easily add UI elements found in Bootstrap.

# Sidebars

There are two different sidebars. One for the homepage and one for the other pages. Add widgets to them.

# CONTRIBUTE!

WP BOOTSTRAP
===================

Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com) in WordPress theme form. 

Used Eddie Machado's Bones for a starting point (https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones) but it doesn't look too much like it any longer. 

FEATURES
________

We’ve built the WP Bootstrap theme so that it could be used as-is as a very basic theme or as a starting point for theme developers. It’s built on top of the Bones theme framework by Eddie Machado and based on v3.1.0 of Bootstrap.

Watch or star this project to keep up with its progress.

Multi-Lingual
_____________

WP-Bootstrap is translated in 4 languages - Spanish, French, Portuguese and German. 

Page Templates
______________

We’ve packaged four different page templates into this theme.

    - Homepage template (seen on the homepage of this site - http://www.320press.com/wp-bootstrap)
    - Standard page with right sidebar (this page)
    - Page with left sidebar
    - Full width page

Theme Options Panel
___________________

We've removed the custom theme options panel in version 3.0. Currently working on moving all of the options that used to appear there over to the theme customizer. 

Shortcodes
__________

We’ve built in some shortcodes so you can easily add UI elements found in Bootstrap.

Sidebars
________

There are two different sidebars. One for the homepage and one for the other pages. Add widgets to them.

CONTRIBUTE!
